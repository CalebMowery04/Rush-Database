Prateek Dontukurti,psd5249,0.3125," Hrc5240: He was really condescending.

It’s totally fine that we don’t watch the same teams. It would have been hard to continue the convo about them, but anyone who remotely follows soccer knows that the NWSL and national team soccer is professional women’s soccer😭 I am assuming he meant to say that I don’t watch men’s soccer. This only bothered me so much because it was on top of the fact that he was scanning the room the whole time I was talking to him and would scoff at things I said throughout the convo to the point where I thought something was like in my teeth or something idek.",4,"rgs5343, hrc5240, ajk6826, agp5326"
